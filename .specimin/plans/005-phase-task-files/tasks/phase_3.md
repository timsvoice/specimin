# Phase 3: Phase File Generation

**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete
**Parallel Opportunities**: 0

- [ ] T006 Add prompt instruction to create phase_N.md files using Write tool with numeric naming in .claude-plugin/commands/cmd.implement.md (AC1, AC2)
- [ ] T007 Add prompt instruction to include phase header (name from implementation.md) in each phase file in .claude-plugin/commands/cmd.implement.md (AC2)
- [ ] T008 Add prompt instruction to copy phase metadata (dependencies, parallel opportunities) into phase files in .claude-plugin/commands/cmd.implement.md (AC2)
- [ ] T009 Add prompt instruction to write filtered task list (preserving original task IDs) to each phase file in .claude-plugin/commands/cmd.implement.md (AC2)
