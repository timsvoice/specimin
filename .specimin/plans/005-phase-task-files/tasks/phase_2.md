# Phase 2: Implementation Parsing Logic

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete
**Parallel Opportunities**: 0

- [ ] T003 Add prompt instruction to read implementation.md and identify phase boundaries (headers like `## Phase N:`) in .claude-plugin/commands/cmd.implement.md (AC2)
- [ ] T004 Add prompt instruction to extract task data (task ID, description, phase number) from checkbox lines in .claude-plugin/commands/cmd.implement.md (AC2, AC3)
- [ ] T005 Add prompt instruction to store extracted data in structured format (phase → tasks mapping) in .claude-plugin/commands/cmd.implement.md (AC2)
