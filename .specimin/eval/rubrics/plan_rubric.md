# Plan Quality Rubric

Evaluate the following implementation plan on three dimensions using a 1-5 scale.

**IMPORTANT:** Plans should NOT contain actual code implementations. They should be architectural and conceptual documents that describe WHAT needs to be built and WHY, not HOW to write the code. Pseudo code is acceptable only if a concept cannot be communicated in another way. Plans containing significant code snippets should be penalized in scoring.

## Scoring Dimensions

### 1. Feasibility (1-5)

Is the technical approach sound and implementable?

**5 - Highly Feasible**
- Technical decisions are well-reasoned and practical
- Chosen technologies are appropriate for the requirements
- Approach accounts for realistic constraints
- No obvious technical red flags

**4 - Feasible**
- Generally sound technical approach
- Technologies are reasonable choices
- Minor concerns but nothing blocking
- Approach is implementable

**3 - Moderately Feasible**
- Some questionable technical choices
- Approach may have challenges but is possible
- Some technologies may be overkill or underpowered
- Implementation will require problem-solving

**2 - Questionable**
- Significant technical concerns
- Poor technology choices for the requirements
- Approach may be difficult to implement
- Contains unrealistic assumptions

**1 - Infeasible**
- Technically unsound approach
- Wrong technologies for the problem
- Cannot be implemented as described
- Fundamental flaws in reasoning

### 2. Detail Level (1-5)

Does the plan provide appropriate level of detail for implementation?

**5 - Well-Detailed**
- Clear component breakdown
- Technology decisions are specific (not vague)
- Integration points well-defined
- Sufficient detail to begin implementation

**4 - Good Detail**
- Components are identified
- Most technology choices specified
- Integration points mentioned
- Minor details may need clarification

**3 - Adequate Detail**
- High-level components identified
- Some technology choices vague
- Integration points need more detail
- Implementable but requires filling in gaps

**2 - Insufficient Detail**
- Vague component descriptions
- Technology choices unclear or missing
- Integration points not defined
- Too high-level to implement directly

**1 - Minimal Detail**
- Almost no specific details
- Reads like requirements, not a plan
- Cannot determine how to implement
- No actionable information

### 3. Phase Organization (1-5)

Are tasks organized into logical, well-sequenced phases?

**5 - Excellently Organized**
- Clear phase boundaries with purpose
- Logical dependency flow
- Phases can be implemented sequentially
- Each phase has clear completion criteria

**4 - Well Organized**
- Phases are logical
- Dependencies mostly clear
- Minor sequencing issues
- Generally follows good task breakdown

**3 - Adequately Organized**
- Phases are present but not optimal
- Some dependency confusion
- Task grouping could be improved
- Workable but not ideal

**2 - Poorly Organized**
- Illogical phase boundaries
- Dependencies unclear or circular
- Tasks are randomly grouped
- Difficult to follow sequence

**1 - Disorganized**
- No logical structure
- Cannot determine implementation order
- Tasks are chaotic
- Missing phase breakdown

## Your Task

Provide scores for each dimension with a brief 1-sentence justification:

**Feasibility:** [1-5]
*Justification:* [One sentence explaining the score]

**Detail Level:** [1-5]
*Justification:* [One sentence explaining the score]

**Phase Organization:** [1-5]
*Justification:* [One sentence explaining the score]
