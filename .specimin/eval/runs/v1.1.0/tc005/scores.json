Comprehensive edge cases, user scenarios, and constraints. Scope perfectly matches feature description with clear boundaries (Out of Scope section). No ambiguities that would block implementation."

Comprehensive coverage of tokenization, parsing, and evaluation algorithms with pseudocode. Addresses all 12 spec requirements with explicit mapping. Includes complexity analysis (O(n) time, O(d) space), extensibility considerations, and detailed testing strategy. Implementation path is crystal clear and highly feasible."

No parallel opportunities marked (appropriate for sequential TDD workflow)."
