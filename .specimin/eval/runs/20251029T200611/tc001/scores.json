All sections comprehensive (7 assumptions, 4 acceptance criteria groups, 4 user scenarios with code, 6 edge cases, 10 out-of-scope items). User scenarios directly map to test cases. Scope exactly matches feature description with appropriate exclusions."

Covers all aspects: data structures, operations, helpers, edge cases, testing strategy, complexity analysis. Highly implementable with concrete pointer operations and 5-phase priority."
